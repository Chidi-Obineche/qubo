How to integrate ActionLib to qubo
1.Create a CMakelists.txt and package.xml file for the actionlib package if needed using either catkin or rosbuild
2.Include a .action file/directory
3. Create a Simple Action Server using the Executive Callback method (This creates the action messages)
 a) You can automatically generate the message files during the make process by inserting the code: rosbuild_find_ros_package(actionlib_msgs)
include(${actionlib_msgs_PACKAGE_PATH}/cmake/actionbuild.cmake)
genaction() in CMakeLists.txt if you used rosbuild or the code: find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS actionlib_msgs) if Catkin was used.
